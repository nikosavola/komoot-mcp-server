"""Starlette middleware for the Eric AI platform integration.

Two concerns:

1. **Internal-secret auth.** When ``INTERNAL_SECRET`` is set in the
   environment, every incoming request (except ``/health``) must
   carry a matching ``Authorization: Bearer <secret>`` header. This
   stops random internet traffic from reaching the MCP endpoint when
   it's exposed behind the platform gateway. When ``INTERNAL_SECRET``
   is unset (local dev) the check is skipped. The exact wire format
   matches the Bitrix reference server so the gateway can use a single
   code path for all backends.

2. **Per-tenant credentials.** The gateway forwards the calling user's
   Komoot creds as JSON in ``x-user-credentials``:

       {"email": "user@example.com", "password": "...", "ors_api_key": "..."}

   The middleware parses that header, builds an :class:`AuthManager`,
   pushes it into the request-local ContextVar via
   :func:`komoot_mcp.context.set_auth_manager`, and resets after the
   downstream handler returns. The optional ``ors_api_key`` field is
   pushed into a separate ContextVar via
   :func:`komoot_mcp.context.set_ors_api_key` so routing tools can pick
   it up per-request. If the header is absent (e.g. stdio mode), the
   env-var fallback in :mod:`komoot_mcp.context` kicks in.

    ``==`` on ``str`` short-circuits at the first differing character, so its
    run time leaks how long the matching prefix was — enough to recover the
    secret byte-by-byte over many requests. ``hmac.compare_digest`` runs in
    time that depends only on the input lengths.

    Two guards keep ``compare_digest`` from raising ``TypeError`` (which would
    turn a would-be 401 into a 500):

    * It rejects ``None``, so a missing header / unset env var returns ``False``
      here rather than blowing up. Empty strings are treated the same way: an
      empty secret must never authenticate anyone.
    * It rejects non-ASCII ``str``. Authorization header bytes are decoded with
      ``latin-1`` upstream, so a single high byte on the wire would otherwise
      reach it, and ``os.environ`` values may hold arbitrary text too. Encoding
      both sides first sidesteps that entirely: ``utf-8``/``surrogatepass`` is
      total (it even round-trips the lone surrogates ``os.environ`` can carry
      from undecodable bytes) and injective, so equality of the encoded bytes
      means exactly what ``str`` equality used to mean.

    * ``Bearer Internal-gateway:<GATEWAY_SECRET>`` — gateway-prefixed form
      (used when ``GATEWAY_SECRET`` is set on the gateway side).

    On rejection, returns a valid JSON-RPC 2.0 error body with code -32001
    (server-defined unauthorized, mirrors Bitrix's -32000 shape).

    Env vars are read at request time so credential rotation works without
    restart. Both comparisons go through :func:`_secrets_match`, which is
    constant-time — this header is the only barrier between the public
    internet and the MCP endpoint, so it must not leak its own contents.
